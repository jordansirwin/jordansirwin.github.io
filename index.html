        <h3><a href="/2017/09/26/recipe-vegan-carbonara-pasta/">Recipe: Vegan Carbonara Pasta</a></h3>
        <p>Full credit goes to my friend, Vlad. Thanks for introducing me to it!</p>

<p>[I’ve never taken a good picture when I’ve cooked this, but next time I will and add it here]</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>I know this seems like alot of steps, but really it’s very simple- the steps are just broken out to help guide you through it. Once you read through it, you’ll see that there’s really only three steps: Boil pasta, roast vegetables, blend sauce.</p>

<p>There’s three components to this dish: pasta, sauce, and roasted vegetables. Since the roasted vegetables take the longest, we’ll start them first. Second, we’ll get the pasta cooking since we’ll want to use some of the water for the sauce. While the pasta is cooking, we’ll sauté the mushrooms since it will be part of the sauce. We’ll then combine mushrooms and sauce, mix it into the pasta, and top with the roasted vegetables.</p>

<p><strong>Servings</strong></p>

<p>6-8 servings</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>1.5 cups of cashews (raw are best, but they don’t have to be)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp black pepper (soaked peppercorns are best, but any black pepper works)</li>
  <li>1 whole bulb of garlic</li>
  <li>2 lbs of pasta (any pasta works, but I enjoy tagliatelle or fettuccine)</li>
  <li>5-6 tbsp salt (maybe more… you’re going to make the pasta water REALLY salty)</li>
  <li>2 bell peppers (your preferred colors)</li>
  <li>1 whole onion (your preferred color)</li>
  <li>2 lbs of mushrooms (portobello, shitake, anything really…)</li>
  <li>2-3 tbsp decent oil (I use coconut oil, but use what you prefer)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

<p>Prior preperation…</p>

<ol>
  <li>Soak cashews in drinking water for a few hours before starting the dish (drinking water because you’re going to reuse some of the water in the sauce).</li>
  <li>If using black peppercorns, soak them in water for the same amount of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Roasted vegetables…</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cut the bell peppers and onions into large julienned slices.</li>
  <li>Peel 4-5 cloves of garlic.</li>
  <li>Mix vegetables with enough oil for a light coating and add a little salt and pepper. Nothing crazy, just make sure there’s decent coverage.</li>
  <li>Spread vegetables on a baking pan. Try not to let them overlap.</li>
  <li>Roast the vegetables in oven (425 F) until they are cooked to your heart’s desire. Some folks like well cooked, some like al dente. I like mine in-between.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pasta…</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a medium/large pot, boil enough water so the pasta can freely move in pot.</li>
  <li>Add 5-6 tbsp of salt to the water, perhaps more. You want the water very salty. Almost like tasting the ocean. I know this seems crazy, but trust me.</li>
  <li>Once boiling, add pasta and boil until nearly done (varies by the pasta type you’re using). You’ll want it very slightly unfinished since we’ll be cooking it a bit with the sauce later (but not much…)</li>
  <li>DON’T THROW OUT THE WATER. We’re going to use some of it in the sauce.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sauce…</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sauté mushrooms with some oil along with 3-4 cloves of garlic until they are nicely browned and soft (sometimes I add onions to this as well).</li>
  <li>Blend cashews with the water you saoked them with (and extra if needed) until lightly creamy. You should be able to pour it out of the blender with only minimal assistance from a spoon. Favor more runny over thick, since we’ll cook it down later. (If you soaked peppercorns, the water used for soaking is incredible to add to the sauce at this point)</li>
  <li>Add the black pepper to the sauce as it’s mixing. You want the sauce to be obviously “peppery”. Add to taste, but trust me- you want way more than you think is enough.</li>
  <li>Add about 1/3 of the sautéd mushrooms and garlic to the blender and blend well. The sauce should be smooth, not chunky.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finishing…</p>

<ol>
  <li>Transfer the pasta water from the pot.</li>
  <li>Add a bit of oil to the pot to prevent pasta from sticking when we mix sauce.</li>
  <li>Add the sauce and pasta into the pot over medium-low heat on stove.</li>
  <li>Add the remaining sautéed mushrooms/garlic to the pot.</li>
  <li>Add some of the salty pasta water at this point, start with 1/2 cup but feel free to add more if you need.</li>
  <li>Mix the pasta, sauce, and mushrooms well over the heat. You’ll want to cook it down a bit so that the sauce is creamy instead of runny. But not so much that it’s super thick and sticky. (It’ll also thicken up more once you take it off the heat).</li>
  <li>Transfer to serving bowl (if you’re fancy…) and top with the roasted vegetables (we keep ours on the side and top when plating).</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This dish offers a lot of variety in texture and flavor, change it around each time you cook:
    <ul>
      <li>Try different types of pasta</li>
      <li>Roast different vegetables</li>
      <li>Sauté different types of mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The secrets to this dish are simple: lots of black pepper in the sauce and lots of salt in the pasta water.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The companions head back to the main corridor where a previous flood nearly wiped them out. Met by charging goblins and the wolf seen atop the chimney, the party has little trouble elimating this threat and continues on.</p>

<p>Ahead they see a wooden bridge crossing over the corridor and a broken and crumbed path to their left. Gosef begins clearing the broken path, paying close attention to the rubble and potential rock slide he may cause. Another loud rush of water appears from ahead, and the players once again dart to the walls for protection. The flood splashes through without victim, but the predicted rock slide hasn’t been avoided. Gosef, waiting for such an event, dives out of the way as the path crumbles around him- several large rocks just missing his head.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-who-is-dis-in-my-cave/bugbear.jpg" alt="Klarg the Bugbear" title="Image from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugbear_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)" /></p>

<p>Thinking there’s only so much water available, the party continues down the main path- directly challenging another flood to come. The wooden bridge passes above them, and ahead they see a dam indicating the source of the floods. Correctly assessing the limited water supply, Gosef sneaks ahead to scout around the dam.</p>

<p>Gosef looks into a large chamber with two ponds being fed by a thundering waterfall from the mountain. Several goblins stand guard at the far end. Welby sneaks up the dam and into the shallow ponds, taking a hidden position just north of the goblins. Gosef emerges from his hiding place west of them and unleashes his arrows, Erdrick prays for his Sacred Flame to ignite his enemies, and Welby fires volleys of arrows from hiding. Together they quickly dispatch these foes.</p>

<p>“Who is dis in my cave?”, loudly snarls the large humanoid creature previously seen by Welby. Walking from the southern chamber, a confident and angry Bugbear wielding a massive morningstar approaches…</p>

<hr />

<p>Entering the cave a second time, the party feels more prepared for what lies ahead. They head back to the kennel with Welby again believing he can succeed where he’s previously failed (fell?). Through the chimney he climbs without err, and he peeks through to the room above.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-entering-the-cave-a-second-time/kennel.jpg" alt="Cave Entrance" title="Image from http://www.ultanya.com/2014/07/lost-mine-of-phandelver-cragmaw-hideout.html. I've modified the original by cropping it." /></p>

<p>Close enough for Welby to smell rests a large wolf, luckily sleeping else Welby’s head may have been a tasty treat. In the center of the room is a small cooking fire, surrounded by several goblins and another rather large humanoid creature. Welby ties off a rope, drops it down the chute, and tries to get a closer look.</p>

<p>At the bottom, Gosef grabs the rope and begins his climb. Unfortunately, history will prove there are more graceful climbers as Gosef clangs and bangs his gear against the stone and slips barely halfway up- immediately alerting the room above. The larger creature stands and commands the goblins around in an unfamiliar language. The goblins hop up and charge towards Welby while the wolf snarls and growls, ready for its snack.</p>

<p>Welby darts down the chimney before they attack, using the rope more as a sliding pole than a grip. Just after landing on the ground the rope begins sliding up the chute, being pulled from above. Erdrick grabs the remaining slack and yanks it with all his might. “Yeeee Ahhhhhhhhh Ohhhh!!!” howls a goblins as it bounces through the chute, banging its body on the ground with a solid thump.</p>

<p>Even though the yelling and activity continues above, the rope now remains still.</p>

<hr />

<p>Recently, a colleague asked me what the difference between an interface and a class was. Here’s what was really being asked:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>“Why would you use an interface instead of an abstract or inherited class?”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After reassuring them that it wasn’t a stupid question (I’m willing to bet most developers have pondered this very question- I did), I went into a long explanation full of lousy examples and bad analogies. I think I was able to make a good case for using interfaces, but just to be sure I’ve decided to add more noise to the Internet.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the basics of an interface, I recommend a quick detour to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173156.aspx">MSDN</a> for an overview. Maybe if you’re lucky, you’ll completely understand and won’t continue reading my attempt to explain them.</p>

<p>In a nutshell- an interface is a set of rules. It regulates its consumer by enforcing that certain methods, delegates, and/or events must be defined. Clear as mud, right? Let’s try an example, followed by a bad car analogy if you’re not so lucky.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span></span>    <span class="c1">// Define an interface to &quot;do something&quot;</span>

        <span class="c1">// maybe cut some hair</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In case the comments weren’t enough, let me explain this example in depth. The class, Foo, desires only one thing: “to do interesting things”. Its entire purpose in life is to perform “interesting things”, regardless of what they are, who they’re from, what side-effects they have, how to do them, etc… Foo simply doesn’t care about the details. This is accomplished via the interface IFooCanUseMeNow.</p>

<p>IFooCanUseMeNow has one rule: “in order to use me, you must implement a method called DoSomething that accepts no parameters and returns no values.” Pretty straight forward (I hope). Foo has a method called DoSomethingInteresting which accepts any object that implements IFooCanUseMeNow. Since all objects that implement IFooCanUseMeNow must (because of the rules) have a method called DoSomething, this means that Foo can invoke this method.</p>

<p>I’ve also declared several classes which implement IFooCanUseMeNow: Bar, Bartender, and Barber. Each one of these classes likely perform different tasks (come on, use your imagination!). The beauty of interfaces is that Foo doesn’t have to know anything about these classes to perform their actions. Because they follow the “rules” set by IFooCanUseMeNow, Foo can interact with them. Foo can now cut hair, serve beers, and… uhmm… sit around being board (hah, bad joke).</p>

<p>In case you’re completely lost, here’s a brief example of how these classes could interact:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span></span>    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ExampleOfUse_WithInterface</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>

      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now the big question: “Why didn’t you just do this by inheriting a class?”. Here’s the exact same situation, but using an abstract class instead of an interface:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span></span>    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ExampleOfUse_WithClass</span>

<p>As you can see, the code is very similar. The class version has a few more details (abstract, virtual, override), but it’s mostly the same code. The Main method that performs all of the work is actually exactly the same. So what’s the problem with using a class instead of an interface?</p>

<p>In such a simple example as this, the lines between a class and interface are a little blurry- they both work, with little reason to choose one over the other. But imagine a slightly more complicated example, where each of our “interesting classes” inherit from a base class:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span></span>    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Bar</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">CounterTop</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IFooCanUseMeNow</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Barber</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IFooCanUseMeNow</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">abstract</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CounterTop</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// base for all types of counter tops</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">abstract</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> 
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// base for all people</span>
    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this example, it should be more apparent why using a class is not a good approach. Remember, C# allows as many interfaces as needed to be implemented but only allows one class to be inherited. With this more complex example, each of the “interesting classes” already inherit their base class, so they wouldn’t be able to inherit the FooCanUseMeNow class. Of course, you could have the low level abstract classes inherit FooCanUseMeNow, but that’s more or less hacking out a solution (just because Bartender and Barber can DoSomething, it doesn’t mean that some other Person can as well).</p>

<p>If you have understood everything thus far, then your imagination should be going wild with thoughts about past projects and examples of when you could have used interfaces. This example is just the tip of the iceberg. When fully understood, entire frameworks can be developed around interfaces- making them extensible and fluid. Nearly every problem can be solved with an interface, so I challenge you to try them out on your next one. I’m not suggesting that you go crazy here- I’m just suggesting that you find a way to use at least one interface to try it out. I think you’ll be satisfied with the outcome.</p>

<p>I hope the noise wasn’t too loud.</p>

<p>P.S. No car analogy comes to mind, so you’re getting off easy this time!</p>

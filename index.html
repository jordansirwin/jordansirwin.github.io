<p>Entering the cave a second time, the party feels more prepared for what lies ahead. They head back to the kennel with Welby again believing he can succeed where he’s previously failed (fell?). Through the chimney he climbs without err, and he peeks through to the room above. </p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-entering-the-cave-a-second-time/kennel.jpg" alt="Cave Entrance" title="Image from http://www.ultanya.com/2014/07/lost-mine-of-phandelver-cragmaw-hideout.html. I've modified the original by cropping it." /></p>

<p>Close enough for Welby to smell rests a large wolf, luckily sleeping else Welby’s head may have been a tasty treat. In the center of the room is a small cooking fire, surrounded by several goblins and another rather large humanoid creature. Welby ties off a rope, drops it down the chute, and tries to get a closer look. </p>

<p>At the bottom, Gosef grabs the rope and begins his climb. Unfortunately, history will prove there are more graceful climbers as Gosef clangs and bangs his gear against the stone and slips barely halfway up- immediately alerting the room above. The larger creature stands and commands the goblins around in an unfamiliar language. The goblins hop up and charge towards Welby while the wolf snarls and growls, ready for its snack. </p>

<p>Welby darts down the chimney before they attack, using the rope more as a sliding pole than a grip. Just after landing on the ground the rope begins sliding up the chute, being pulled from above. Erdrick grabs the remaining slack and yanks it with all his might. “Yeeee Ahhhhhhhhh Ohhhh!!!” howls a goblins as it bounces through the chute, banging its body on the ground with a solid thump. </p>

<p>Even though yelling and activity continues above, the rope now remains still.</p>

<p>A cool stream shares the cave’s entrance, the flow indicating an upwards grade leading inside. The main corridor continues forward, but just to the right is a room housing snarls and growls. Gosef turns the corner with his bow ready, identifying a couple of wolves just as they jump at his face. The wolves are contained as quickly as they pounce, bound by chains linking them to a nearby stalagmite. Gosef takes his shots and Welby joins from behind. The wolves continue to pounce, but the chains provide just enough strength to prevent major damage until downed.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-a-cool-stream-shares-the-caves-entrance/cave_stream.jpg" alt="Cave Entrance" title="Image from http://erinandstepheninnewzealand.blogspot.com/2011/01/castle-hill-cave-stream.html. I've modified the original: Removed person sitting on rock, flipped horizontally, and cropped." /></p>

<p>The room is foul from rotted garbage and bone, likely serving as a kennel for the wolves. On the far side sits a chimney of sort, more frequently used as a garbage chute it seems. Welby, convinced it leads somewhere useful, begins climbing. The chimney leads him nearly 30 feet straight up before a terrible decision, loose grip, and wicked gravity pull him back down to his companions. Gosef notices the crumbling debris, correctly predicts Welby’s fall, and throws his backpack at the base of the chimney just as Welby crashes into view, converting his fall from deadly to death defying.</p>

<p>Barely breathing, Welby looks to his saviour and smiles- or perhaps it was a grimace. Studying the effort, the party decides they should find another route and heads back through the main corridor.</p>

<p>Not long into their new path, a flood of water races through the cave directly at them. Welby and Gosef jump against the walls, resting their bodies flat and finding just enough grip to hold against the tide. Erdrick wasn’t so lucky and takes the mass directly against his chest- pushing him down the corrider back to the cave’s entrance.</p>

<p>Barely able to stand, Erdrick takes a deep breath and once again considers their path.</p>

<p>The trip takes a couple of days before the ruins of an ancient city balancing the foundation of a new one appears on the horizon. Phandalin is both old and new, large and small, relevant and forgotten- and it’s the destination for the party’s delivery of mining supplies.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-08-26-gundren-never-arrived-as-expected/Phandalin.jpg" alt="Phandalin" title="Image from http://heropresstwo.blogspot.com/2014/06/map-monday-phandalin.html" /></p>

<p>Arriving at Barthen’s Provisions, Elmar Barthen greets the party and beckons his employees to unload the wagon. Erdrick and Elmar strike a conversation resulting in payment for their work, but also learning that Gundren never arrived as expected. Outraged that he should have known the dead horses belonged to his own cousin, Erdrick rallies his companions to return to the trail and find Gundren. All agree but Welby, who claims personal business he needs to tend.</p>

<p>Only in a town a couple of hours, the party makes their exit. Welby watches from the streets, reflecting on the small adventure he’d just had. That brief smile diminishes to suprise when shouts burst from behind him, “Hey Welby! Is that you? I know that’s you! The Redbrands have been waiting on you to come back!”. Now thinking to settle his business another time, Welby rejoins his companions for their next adventure. </p>

<p>Days later, they rediscover the goblin trail and follow it through snares and pit traps (some spotted, some triggered). Eventually, the trail opens to a clearing and a cave. There’s some debate about what approach should be taken when arrows begin flying through the air. Dodging and charging, some goblins are slayed and some wounds are had. </p>

<p>The companions have discovered The Cragmaw Hideout.</p>

<p>The horses haven’t been dead long, just a few hours according to Erdrick. Welby darts south into the woods and a defensive position is established around the wagon. Almost immediately a volley of black arrows burst from the northern trees. Welby reacts with his own shots, dropping a once hidden goblin.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-08-18-the-horses-havent-been-dead-long/EOPinheyForestTrails_1L.jpg" alt="Forest Trail" title="Image from http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/pinhey-forest-trails" /></p>

<p>Two other goblins charge the wagon, snarling and brandishing worn and rusted scimitars. Erdrick embraces them both, blocking slashes with his shield and responding harshly with his mace. Gosef raises his bow to the northern woods, firing arrow after arrow at the goblins conceiling themselves in the shadows. Welby charges across the road, continuing to fire his own bow. Goblins drop all around, but one stands strong against the party. A shining example of combat and finesse, a champion of melee mastery, a thorn in Erdricks side, but in the end nothing more than a stain on his mace.</p>

<p>With four goblins dead, it becomes clear that they are related to the ambush against the horses and their masters. Welby searches the northern woods, finding a trail not far from the road. He returns to find Gosef and Erdrick studying the site. Other than an empty map tube, nothing of interest is discovered. Eager to complete their job and earn their wages, they return to their wagon and continue towards Phandalin.</p>

<p>A dwarf, a halfling, and a human are sitting in a bar, barely aware of each others presence. A gruff and tough dwarf swings the doors open and announces available work escorting his wagon of goods south to the mining town of Phandalin. Many in the room snark at the offer, some consider it deeply, but the noted few rise to their feet and inquire for further details.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-08-17-a-dwarf-halfling-and-human-are-sitting-in-a-bar/old-world-tavern.jpg" alt="Old Tavern" title="Image from http://dungeonsmaster.com/2010/05/tavern-trappings/" /></p>

<p>Gundren Rockseeker excitingly tells the three that he needs mining equipment brought south for him and his brothers. They’ve found a mine of interest and want to delve further into it- but it will take months of work and more equipment is required. “The trek could be dangerous as bandits and goblins are known to wander the route, and it will take several days at the least.” Gundren highlights the risks of the trip, but can’t hide his smile or glowing cheeks each time he mentions the mine. </p>

<p>After a deep breath, he finally looks to his audience and bolsters his loudest laugh yet. “Erdrick Gruffbeard! I didn’t know you were in town!” Cousins by blood, Erdrick takes his offer without hesitation and Gundren shows some relief knowing his own blood will take part. Looking at the others, he asks “Who be the other here, then?”</p>

<p>“Welby Greenbottle”, states the halfling. “I’m happy to travel to Phandalin. I have family in the area I haven’t seen in ages.” Clearly not willing to say anything more, Gundren simply nods with a smile and turns to the human. “Gosef of Thundertree. Glory comes to those who work for it, and I’m ready to work.” With a deep satisfied laugh, Gundren escorts his hired help to the wagon of goods. </p>

<p>The wagon is full of food, mining equipment, and other common items as previously declared. Gundren mounts his pony, “I’ll pay each of you 10 gold when this wagon arrives in Phandalin. I’m headed there now so I’ll be there well in advance. When you arrive with the wagon your gold will be waiting for you.”</p>

<p>The party rests for the night and gets on their way in the morning. They take The High Road south from Neverwinter and a couple of days pass without event, then east down the Triboar Trial. Suddenly, the wagon stops. Ahead on the road are two dead horses blocking the wagon from passing. Small black arrows preclude from their bodies…</p>

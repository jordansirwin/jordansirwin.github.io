        <h3><a href="/2014/08/10/the-low-status-of-software-engineers/">The Low Status of Software Engineers</a></h3>
        <p><a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/about/">Michael O. Church’s</a> intriguing article exploring the low status of software engineers to upper management. </p>

<p><a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other-half-works-an-adventure-in-the-low-status-of-software-engineers/">How the Other Half Works: an Adventure in the Low Status of Software Engineers</a>.</p>

<p>A few fun tidbits:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>… for a point that I’ll come back to, software engineers lack the social status necessary to make others invest in them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And…</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>For a software engineer, “relocation” is usually some shitty $3,000 lump-sum package, because “software engineer”, to executives, means “22-year-old clueless male with few possessions, and with free storage of the parental category”. On the other hand, if you’re a manager, you might be seen as a real human being with actual concerns about relocating to another part of the country.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And…</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>What most of us don’t realize is that this culture of mandatory “passion” lowers our social status, because it encourages us to work unreasonably hard and irrespective of conditions. The fastest way to lose social status is to show acceptance of low social status.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Finally…</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>If programmers want to be taken seriously, and we should be taken seriously and we certainly should want this, we’re going to have to take stock of our compromised position and fix it, even if that’s “getting political”. We’re going to have to stop glorifying pointless self-sacrifice for what is ultimately someone else’s business transaction, and start asserting ourselves and our values. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Go read it yourself. Please. You deserve it.</p>

        <p>Useless error message in Visual Studio when committing code into TFS that hasn’t been saved. It’s both uninformative and completely disconnected from the problem.</p>

<p>While I agree that commiting unsaved code into source control should be prevented, I also believe a reasonable error message to identify the problem is too.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rules/">D&D House Rules</a></h3>
        <p>With D&amp;D 5e launched and new campaigns firing up all around the globe, I thought I’d call out common house rules I like to use. These rules aren’t new or groundbreaking, and are heavily influenced from various systems I’ve played throughout my life. I simply enjoy playing games that have some flavor of these rules, so I apply them as neccessary.</p>

<p>Each rule will be its own post, so here’s a Master List:</p>

        <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-skill-check-uncertainty/">D&D House Rule&#58; Skill Check Uncertainty</a></h3>
        <p>This is part of the <a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rules/">D&amp;D House Rules</a> series.</p>

<p>It’s difficult for players to not meta-game dice rolls (ie: Low rolls are assumed failure and high rolls success). To help avoid this belief, during many Skill Checks I secretely roll a d20 as well. If my roll is a Natural 20, then the player’s result is reversed: Success = Failure, Failure = Success. </p>

<p>I don’t <em>always</em> do this and it’s very subjective when I do- mainly when characters are attempting things with a natural element of uncertainly. Also, I frequently pre-roll a list of d20 results ahead of time and reference it instead of rolling real-time (expedited and even more secretive). If the player rolled a Natural 20 or Natural 1, I don’t do this.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Terg wants to check for signs of an ambush ahead. He rolls a Perception check and nails it with a 19 + 7 (26). This is an outstanding number, so generally the player expects correct information. My roll, though, was a Natural 20.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Confident in his awareness, Terg is certain there is no ambush ahead. The party marches forward without much caution and pays for it with a suprise attack of wargs leaping from the woods!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Terg overlooked a subtle paw track on the road, a fresh and clear sign of wargs ahead. Another player could have noticed the tracks, but Terg did not. </p>

<p>The point of this rule isn’t to undo a characters success, it’s to remind the players that they can’t assume their characters are right or wrong based on the dice rolls alone. Had Terg rolled a 3 and me a Natural 20, he may have concluded the same thing- but noticed the track at the last second before they marched on.</p>

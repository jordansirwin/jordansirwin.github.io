        <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rules/">D&D House Rules</a></h3>
        <p>With D&amp;D 5e launched and new campaigns firing up all around the globe, I thought I’d call out common house rules I like to use. These rules aren’t new or groundbreaking, and are heavily influenced from various systems I’ve played throughout my life. I simply enjoy playing games that have some flavor of these rules, so I apply them as neccessary.</p>

<p>Each rule will be its own post, so here’s a Master List:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-skill-check-uncertainty/">Skill Check Uncertainty</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-retrying-a-skill-check/">Retrying a skill check</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-critical-fumble/">Critical Fumble</a> </li>
</ul>

        <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-skill-check-uncertainty/">D&D House Rule&#58; Skill Check Uncertainty</a></h3>
        <p>This is part of the <a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rules/">D&amp;D House Rules</a> series.</p>

<p>It’s difficult for players to not meta-game dice rolls (ie: Low rolls are assumed failure and high rolls success). To help avoid this belief, during many Skill Checks I secretely roll a d20 as well. If my roll is a Natural 20, then the player’s result is reversed: Success = Failure, Failure = Success. </p>

<p>I don’t <em>always</em> do this and it’s very subjective when I do- mainly when characters are attempting things with a natural element of uncertainly. Also, I frequently pre-roll a list of d20 results ahead of time and reference it instead of rolling real-time (expedited and even more secretive). If the player rolled a Natural 20 or Natural 1, I don’t do this.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Terg wants to check for signs of an ambush ahead. He rolls a Perception check and nails it with a 19 + 7 (26). This is an outstanding number, so generally the player expects correct information. My roll, though, was a Natural 20.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Confident in his awareness, Terg is certain there is no ambush ahead. The party marches forward without much caution and pays for it with a suprise attack of wargs leaping from the woods!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Terg overlooked a subtle paw track on the road, a fresh and clear sign of wargs ahead. Another player could have noticed the tracks, but Terg did not. </p>

<p>The point of this rule isn’t to undo a characters success, it’s to remind the players that they can’t assume their characters are right or wrong based on the dice rolls alone. Had Terg rolled a 3 and me a Natural 20, he may have concluded the same thing- but noticed the track at the last second before they marched on.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-retrying-a-skill-check/">D&D House Rule&#58; Retrying a Skill Check</a></h3>
        <p>This is part of the <a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rules/">D&amp;D House Rules</a> series.</p>

<p>Sometimes a player fails a skill check and there’s no good reason they can’t just try again. Most systems allow the player to <em>Take 10</em> or <em>Take 20</em>, which is an acceptable way to handle most scenarios. Otherwise, I allow the player check again with incrementing difficulty: Each failed check will increase the difficulty of the next check by the failure amount.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Seri is a stealthy rogue that’s found herself alone with a locked treasure chest. She attempts to pick the lock (DC 15), but fails with a 11 (failed by 4). Since the player is not in combat and skillfully stealthed her way into this postiion, there’s nothing stopping her from trying again. I allow another attempt, but now the DC is 19 (DC 15 + 4). </p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Seri recognises this kind of lock and is confident she should be able to pick it. Knowing she’s alone and unknown, she attempts to pick the lock again (DC 19).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The player rolls terribly, a 3 (failed by 16). Now, the difficulty to pick the lock is a whopping DC 35 (DC 19 + 16).</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Seri’s lockpick breaks off inside the lock and snaps loudly. You overhear someone asking “What was that?”.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, continued failures will identify the check as impossible or introduce new circumstances to the scenario (or both!).</p>

        <h3><a href="/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rule-critical-fumble/">D&D House Rule&#58; Critical Fumble</a></h3>
        <p>This is part of the <a href="http://www.jordanirwin.net/2014/07/27/dnd-house-rules/">D&amp;D House Rules</a> series.</p>

<p>A Natural 1 on any Combat or Skill Check is a Fumble. The player rolls another d20 to determine <em>how badly they fumbled</em>. High rolls generally represent no real threat or danger, rolls under 5 represent a setback of some kind, and a Natural 1 is a Critical Fumble that results in a major setback- maybe even pain and/or agony.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Druber charges a goblin, but rolls a 1 on the attack roll. Knowing this is some kind of Fumble, he rolls another d20 resulting in a 13 (not a Critical Fumble).  </p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Druber’s charge is clumsy and off-balanced, making him look silly to those who may have seen it happen. Even the goblin laughs at him!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On his next turn, Druber attacks- again rolling a Natural 1. His second roll is also a Natural 1, representing a Critical Fumble. </p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Druber is so embarrassed by his charge that he over compensates his sword thrust- losing grip and flinging his weapon 10 feet forward. Additionally, he’s lost balance and fallen face down into the ground. Now he’s weaponless and prone!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Had his second roll been 2-5 maybe he’d be weaponless or prone, but not both.</p>

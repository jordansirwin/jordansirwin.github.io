      <h2>Setting up this blog, Part 2</h2>
      <p>Full Series: <a href="/2014/07/09/setting-up-this-blog-part-1.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="/2014/07/09/setting-up-this-blog-part-2.html">Part 2</a></p>

<p>A great deal of time was spent getting my environment configured reasonably sane. By <em>environment</em>, I mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directory structure.</li>
  <li>Git.</li>
  <li>Writing.</li>
  <li>Previewing.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jordansirwin/jordansirwin.github.io">My directory structure can be viewed on GitHub</a> (this blog and its source is wide-open for your review). I went through a few iterations, and may still go through more, but it’s a fairly standard structure for GitHub Pages + Jekyll.</p>

<h4 id="git">Git</h4>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages has great documentation available</a>, but it wasn’t a silver bullet. GitHub Pages requires at least two branches: One to host the blog itself and one to store the source code for generating the blog. GitHub Pages respects a magical branch called <em>gh-pages</em> or the <em>master</em> branch. I chose to go with <em>master</em> for hosting and <em>source</em> for the source code. Admittedly, I didn’t get this right at first (or second, third, or tenth). </p>

<p>Since I already had some source code in the <em>master</em> branch, I needed to change things around. I created a new branch for the source code:</p>

<pre><code>git branch source --orphan
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I needed to cleanup my <em>master</em> branch of everything but the <em>.git</em> folder (well, anything that doesn’t start with a period (.):</p>

<pre><code>find . -regex "\./[^.].*" -exec rm -rf {} \;
git commit -m "insert kewl comment here"
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a clean <em>master</em> and a fully loaded <em>source</em>. I’ll never do anything directly in the <em>master</em> branch. Everything will be done in <em>source</em>, then deployed (<strong>NOT</strong> merged!) to <em>master</em>. These two branches will never merge together again. </p>

<h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>

<p>Deciding what to write with was easy, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime</a>. Cross-platform, settings configured via JSON files, great plugin support, and sports a minimal UI- I love it. I currently use <a href="https://github.com/jordansirwin/dotfiles/tree/master/sublime">pretty basic settings</a> and only two plugins: <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net">Package Control</a> for installing packages (plugins) and <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Markdown%20Preview">Markdown Preview</a> for lovely Markdown syntax highlights.</p>

<h4 id="previewing">Previewing</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, Markdown Preview offers some nice Markdown enhancements- including previewing via your browser. While I do use this feature when writing notes or other Markdown based documents, this blog is previewed via Jekyll for an identical match to the final product. </p>

<p>To setup a local copy of the blog at <em>http://localhost:4000</em> and automatically update modified files for real-time previewing, I use this command line from my <em>source</em> branch:</p>

<pre><code>jekyll serve -w
</code></pre>

<p>I use Safari to browse the URL and refresh as I want to preview changes.</p>

      <h2>Setting up this blog, Part 1</h2>
      <p>Full Series: <a href="/2014/07/09/setting-up-this-blog-part-1.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="/2014/07/09/setting-up-this-blog-part-2.html">Part 2</a></p>

<p>I think it’s proper that my first post on the new blogging system is about setting up the new blogging system. So meta, much wow.</p>

<p>Here were my goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid WYSIWYG.</li>
  <li>Learn something new and relevant.</li>
  <li>Content must be reasonably exportable.</li>
  <li>Writing should be as exciting as the content.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these goals in mind, I’ve switched away from Blogger and onto GitHub Pages. But not <em>just</em> GitHub Pages, a full technology stack of goodness to learn and explore with it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sublime for writing.</li>
  <li>Markdown for markup.</li>
  <li>Jekyll for static compilation.</li>
  <li>Git for source control.</li>
  <li>GitHub Pages for hosting.</li>
  <li>Hover for domain registration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I’ve dedicated myself to doing it the <em>hard way</em> via command line- so I’ve been forced to learn a great deal more about OSX, Terminal, and Unix Commands. </p>

<p>In the interest of finishing a post, I’m going to break this into multiple parts. </p>

      <h2>Apple TV Speculation</h2>
      <p>With years of speculation on Apple’s plan for “reinventing the television”, I figure it’s time for me to increase the noise.</p>

<p>My Apple TV Prediction In Bullets For Guided Reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No significant changes to the existing Apple TV (other than boosted hardware specs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overhaul to the existing UI, primarily to accommodate my actual prediction in the next point…</p>
  </li>
  <li>A new, psuedo-optional, remote that’s a striped down iPod Touch. This “iRemote” is simply a thin client for the Apple TV, offering:
    <ul>
      <li>Apple TV navigation mirrored on the iRemote. (This is the primary, and significant, difference from the existing Remote App)</li>
      <li>Text inputs trigger the iOS onscreen keyboard.</li>
      <li>Apps can generate any kind of digital input device they want (game controllers!) on the entire screen of the iRemote. Generic controls available by default, including the existing Remote App controls.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apple TV continues to cost only $99, but without the iRemote.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>iRemote bought separately for $99.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All existing iOS devices are iRemotes via an updated Remote App.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Existing Apple TVs are backwards compatible with the iRemote via a software update.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a plan like this, Apple could potentially dominate the television market without actually entering the television market. Who cares what TV you bought or where you got it from, just add on the Apple TV for your entertainment needs!</p>

<p><em>edit: Clarified that default controls would be provided for backwards compatibility. Custom controls are optional, not required.</em></p>

<p>Entering the cave a second time, the party feels more prepared for what lies ahead. They head back to the kennel with Welby again believing he can succeed where he’s previously failed (fell?). Through the chimney he climbs without err, and he peeks through to the room above. </p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-entering-the-cave-a-second-time/kennel.jpg" alt="Cave Entrance" title="Image from http://www.ultanya.com/2014/07/lost-mine-of-phandelver-cragmaw-hideout.html. I've modified the original by cropping it." /></p>

<p>Close enough for Welby to smell rests a large wolf, luckily sleeping else Welby’s head may have been a tasty treat. In the center of the room is a small cooking fire, surrounded by several goblins and another rather large humanoid creature. Welby ties off a rope, drops it down the chute, and tries to get a closer look. </p>

<p>At the bottom, Gosef grabs the rope and begins his climb. Unfortunately, history will prove there are more graceful climbers as Gosef clangs and bangs his gear against the stone and slips barely halfway up- immediately alerting the room above. The larger creature stands and commands the goblins around in an unfamiliar language. The goblins hop up and charge towards Welby while the wolf snarls and growls, ready for its snack. </p>

<p>Welby darts down the chimney before they attack, using the rope more as a sliding pole than a grip. Just after landing on the ground the rope begins sliding up the chute, being pulled from above. Erdrick grabs the remaining slack and yanks it with all his might. “Yeeee Ahhhhhhhhh Ohhhh!!!” howls a goblins as it bounces through the chute, banging its body on the ground with a solid thump. </p>

<p>Even though yelling and activity continues above, the rope now remains still.</p>

<hr />

<p>Recently, a colleague asked me what the difference between an interface and a class was. Here’s what was really being asked:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>“Why would you use an interface instead of a class?”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After reassuring them that it wasn’t a stupid question (I’m willing to bet most developers have pondered this very question- I did), I went into a long explanation full of lousy examples and bad analogies. I think I was able to make a good case for using interfaces, but just to be sure I’ve decided to add more noise to the Internet.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the basics of an interface, I recommend a quick detour to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173156.aspx">MSDN</a> for an overview. Maybe if you’re lucky, you’ll completely understand and won’t continue reading my attempt to explain them.</p>

<p>In a nutshell- an interface is a set of rules. It regulates its consumer by enforcing that certain methods, delegates, and/or events must be defined. Clear as mud, right? Let’s try an example, followed by a bad car analogy if you’re not so lucky.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span class="c1">// Define an interface to &quot;do something&quot;</span>

        <span class="c1">// like serve a beer</span>

        <span class="c1">// maybe cut some hair</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In case the comments weren’t enough, let me explain this example in depth. The class, Foo, desires only one thing: “to do interesting things”. Its entire purpose in life is to perform “interesting things”, regardless of what they are, who they’re from, what side-effects they have, how to do them, etc… Foo simply doesn’t care about the details. This is accomplished via the interface IFooCanUseMeNow.</p>

<p>IFooCanUseMeNow has one rule: “in order to use me, you must implement a method called DoSomething that accepts no parameters and returns no values.” Pretty straight forward (I hope). Foo has a method called DoSomethingInteresting which accepts any object that implements IFooCanUseMeNow. Since all objects that implement IFooCanUseMeNow must (because of the rules) have a method called DoSomething, this means that Foo can invoke this method.</p>

<p>I’ve also declared several classes which implement IFooCanUseMeNow: Bar, Bartender, and Barber. Each one of these classes likely perform different tasks (come on, use your imagination!). The beauty of interfaces is that Foo doesn’t have to know anything about these classes to perform their actions. Because they follow the “rules” set by IFooCanUseMeNow, Foo can interact with them. Foo can now cut hair, serve beers, and… uhmm… sit around being board (hah, bad joke).</p>

<p>In case you’re completely lost, here’s a brief example of how these classes could interact:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ExampleOfUse_WithInterface</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>

      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now the big question: “Why didn’t you just do this by inheriting a class?”. Here’s the exact same situation, but using an abstract class instead of an interface:</p>

    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the code is very similar. The class version has a few more details (abstract, virtual, override), but it’s mostly the same code. The Main method that performs all of the work is actually exactly the same. So what’s the problem with using a class instead of an interface?</p>

<p>In such a simple example as this, the lines between a class and interface are a little blurry- they both work, with little reason to choose one over the other. But imagine a slightly more complicated example, where each of our “interesting classes” inherit from a base class:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c#" data-lang="c#"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Bar</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">CounterTop</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IFooCanUseMeNow</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Bartender</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IFooCanUseMeNow</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Barber</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Person</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IFooCanUseMeNow</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">DoSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">abstract</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CounterTop</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// base for all types of counter tops</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">abstract</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> 
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// base for all people</span>
    <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, it should be more apparent why using a class is not a good approach. Remember, C# allows as many interfaces as needed to be implemented but only allows one class to be inherited. With this more complex example, each of the “interesting classes” already inherit their base class, so they wouldn’t be able to inherit the FooCanUseMeNow class. Of course, you could have the low level abstract classes inherit FooCanUseMeNow, but that’s more or less hacking out a solution (just because Bartender and Barber can DoSomething, it doesn’t mean that some other Person can as well).</p>

<p>If you have understood everything thus far, then your imagination should be going wild with thoughts about past projects and examples of when you could have used interfaces. This example is just the tip of the iceberg. When fully understood, entire frameworks can be developed around interfaces- making them extensible and fluid. Nearly every problem can be solved with an interface, so I challenge you to try them out on your next one. I’m not suggesting that you go crazy here- I’m just suggesting that you find a way to use at least one interface to try it out. I think you’ll be satisfied with the outcome.</p>

<p>I hope the noise wasn’t too loud.</p>

<p>P.S. No car analogy comes to mind, so you’re getting off easy this time!</p>

<hr />

<p>A cool stream shares the cave’s entrance, the flow indicating an upwards grade leading inside. The main corridor continues forward, but just to the right is a room housing snarls and growls. Gosef turns the corner with his bow ready, identifying a couple of wolves just as they jump at his face. The wolves are contained as quickly as they pounce, bound by chains linking them to a nearby stalagmite. Gosef takes his shots and Welby joins from behind. The wolves continue to pounce, but the chains provide just enough strength to prevent major damage until downed.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-a-cool-stream-shares-the-caves-entrance/cave_stream.jpg" alt="Cave Entrance" title="Image from http://erinandstepheninnewzealand.blogspot.com/2011/01/castle-hill-cave-stream.html. I've modified the original: Removed person sitting on rock, flipped horizontally, and cropped." /></p>

<p>The room is foul from rotted garbage and bone, likely serving as a kennel for the wolves. On the far side sits a chimney of sort, more frequently used as a garbage chute it seems. Welby, convinced it leads somewhere useful, begins climbing. The chimney leads him nearly 30 feet straight up before a terrible decision, loose grip, and wicked gravity pull him back down to his companions. Gosef notices the crumbling debris, correctly predicts Welby’s fall, and throws his backpack at the base of the chimney just as Welby crashes into view, converting his fall from deadly to death defying.</p>

<p>Barely breathing, Welby looks to his saviour and smiles- or perhaps it was a grimace. Studying the effort, the party decides they should find another route and heads back through the main corridor.</p>

<p>Not long into their new path, a flood of water races through the cave directly at them. Welby and Gosef jump against the walls, resting their bodies flat and finding just enough grip to hold against the tide. Erdrick wasn’t so lucky and takes the mass directly against his chest- pushing him down the corrider back to the cave’s entrance.</p>

<p>Barely able to stand, Erdrick takes a deep breath and once again considers their path.</p>

<p>The trip takes a couple of days before the ruins of an ancient city balancing the foundation of a new one appears on the horizon. Phandalin is both old and new, large and small, relevant and forgotten- and it’s the destination for the party’s delivery of mining supplies.</p>

<p>Arriving at Barthen’s Provisions, Elmar Barthen greets the party and beckons his employees to unload the wagon. Erdrick and Elmar strike a conversation resulting in payment for their work, but also learning that Gundren never arrived as expected. Outraged that he should have known the dead horses belonged to his own cousin, Erdrick rallies his companions to return to the trail and find Gundren. All agree but Welby, who claims personal business he needs to tend.</p>

<p>Only in a town a couple of hours, the party makes their exit. Welby watches from the streets, reflecting on the small adventure he’d just had. That brief smile diminishes to suprise when shouts burst from behind him, “Hey Welby! Is that you? I know that’s you! The Redbrands have been waiting on you to come back!”. Now thinking to settle his business another time, Welby rejoins his companions for their next adventure. </p>

<p>Days later, they rediscover the goblin trail and follow it through snares and pit traps (some spotted, some triggered). Eventually, the trail opens to a clearing and a cave. There’s some debate about what approach should be taken when arrows begin flying through the air. Dodging and charging, some goblins are slayed and some wounds are had. </p>

<p>The companions have discovered The Cragmaw Hideout.</p>

<p>The horses haven’t been dead long, just a few hours according to Erdrick. Welby darts south into the woods and a defensive position is established around the wagon. Almost immediately a volley of black arrows burst from the northern trees. Welby reacts with his own shots, dropping a once hidden goblin.</p>

<p>Two other goblins charge the wagon, snarling and brandishing worn and rusted scimitars. Erdrick embraces them both, blocking slashes with his shield and responding harshly with his mace. Gosef raises his bow to the northern woods, firing arrow after arrow at the goblins conceiling themselves in the shadows. Welby charges across the road, continuing to fire his own bow. Goblins drop all around, but one stands strong against the party. A shining example of combat and finesse, a champion of melee mastery, a thorn in Erdricks side, but in the end nothing more than a stain on his mace.</p>

<p>With four goblins dead, it becomes clear that they are related to the ambush against the horses and their masters. Welby searches the northern woods, finding a trail not far from the road. He returns to find Gosef and Erdrick studying the site. Other than an empty map tube, nothing of interest is discovered. Eager to complete their job and earn their wages, they return to their wagon and continue towards Phandalin.</p>

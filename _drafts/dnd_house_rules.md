#### Retrying a skill check ####

If a player fails a skill check, and there's no good reason they can't just try again, I increase the DC of the check by the amount they failed the previous check.

_Example_
The party rogue wants to pick a lock (DC 15). The roll is made, but failes with an 11. Since the player is not in combat and skillfully stealthed his way into this postiion, he can try again- but now the DC is 19 (Original DC 15 + (15 - 11)). Another failure? Add the difference again! Eventually, failures will identify the lock as impossible to pick.

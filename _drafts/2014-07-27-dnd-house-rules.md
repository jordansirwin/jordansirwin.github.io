title: D&D House Rule: Skill Check Uncertainty
---

With D&D 5e launched and new campaigns firing up all around the globe, I thought I'd call out common house rules I like to use. These rules aren't new or groundbreaking, and are heavily influenced from various systems I've played throughout my life. I simply enjoy playing games that have some flavor of these rules, so I apply them as neccessary.


#### Retrying a skill check ####

If a player fails a skill check, and there's no good reason they can't just try again, I increase the DC of the check by the amount they failed the previous check.

_Example_  
The party rogue wants to pick a lock (DC 15). The roll is made, but failes with an 11. Since the player is not in combat and skillfully stealthed his way into this postiion, he can try again- but now the DC is 19 (Original DC 15 + (15 - 11)). Another failure? Add the difference again! Eventually, failures will identify the lock as impossible to pick.


#### Skill Check Uncertainty ####

It's difficult for players to not meta-game dice rolls (ie: Low rolls are assumed failure and high rolls success). To help avoid this belief, during many Skill Checks I secretely roll a d20 as well. If my roll is a Natural 20, then the player's result is reversed: Success == Failure, Failure == Success. 

I don't _always_ do this and it's very subjective when I do- mainly when characters are attempting things with a natural element of uncertainly. Also, I frequently pre-roll a list of d20 results ahead of time and reference it instead of rolling real-time (expedited and even more secretive). If the player rolled a Natural 20 or Natural 1, I don't do this.

##### Example #####

Terg wants to check for signs of an ambush ahead. He rolls a Perception check and nails it with a 19 + 7 (26). This is an outstanding number, so generally the player expects correct information. My roll, though, was a Natural 20.

>
Confident in his awareness, Terg is certain there is no ambush ahead. The party marches forward without much caution, and pays for it with a suprise attack from wargs leaping out of the woods!
>

Terg overlooked a subtle paw track on the road, a fresh and clear sign of wargs ahead. Another player may still notice the tracks, but Terg did not. 

The point of this rule isn't to undo a characters success, it's to remind the players that they can't assume their characters are right or wrong based on the dice rolls alone. Had Terg rolled a 3 and me a Natural 20, he may have concluded the same thing- but noticed the track at the last second before they marched on.


#### Critical Fumble ####

A Natural 1 on any Combat or Skill Check is a Fumble. The player then rolls another d20 to determine _how bad they fumbled_. This is purely subjective for the DM, but higher rolls generally represent no real threat or danger. Rolls under 5 represent a setback of some kind, and a Natural 1 is a Critical Fumble and results in a major setback- maybe even pain and/or agony.

_Example_  
Druber charges a goblin, but rolls a 1 on the attack roll. Knowing this is some kind of Fumble, he rolls another d20 resulting in a 13 (not a Critical Fumble).  
	
>
Druber's charge is clumsy and off-balanced, making him look silly to those who may have seen it happen. Even the goblin laughs at him!
>

On his next turn, Druber attacks- again rolling a Natural 1. His second roll is also a Natural 1, representing a Critical Fumble. 

>
Druber is so embarrassed by his charge that he over compensates his sword thrust- losing grip and flinging his weapon 10 feet forward. Additionally, he's lost balance and fallen face down into the ground. Now he's weaponless and Prone!
>

Had his second roll been 2-5 maybe he'd be weaponless or prone, but not both.

  <p><em>Part 3 of Lost Mine of Phandelver. <a href="/2014/08/17/lost-mine-of-phandelver/">The full series may be found here</a>. Here lies actual accounts of fictional events. Spoilers exists if you haven’t yet played this adventure.</em></p>

<p>The trip takes a couple of days before the ruins of an ancient city balancing the foundation of a new one appears on the horizon. Phandalin is both old and new, large and small, relevant and forgotten- and it’s the destination for the party’s delivery of mining supplies.</p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-08-26-gundren-never-arrived-as-expected/Phandalin.jpg" alt="Phandalin" title="Image from http://heropresstwo.blogspot.com/2014/06/map-monday-phandalin.html" /></p>

<p>Arriving at Barthen’s Provisions, Elmar Barthen greets the party and beckons his employees to unload the wagon. Erdrick and Elmar strike a conversation resulting in payment for their work, but also learning that Gundren never arrived as expected. Outraged that he should have known the dead horses belonged to his own cousin, Erdrick rallies his companions to return to the trail and find Gundren. All agree but Welby, who claims personal business he needs to tend.</p>

<p>Only in a town a couple of hours, the party makes their exit. Welby watches from the streets, reflecting on the small adventure he’d just had. That brief smile diminishes to suprise when shouts burst from behind him, “Hey Welby! Is that you? I know that’s you! The Redbrands have been waiting on you to come back!”. Now thinking to settle his business another time, Welby rejoins his companions for their next adventure. </p>

<p>Days later, they rediscover the goblin trail and follow it through snares and pit traps (some spotted, some triggered). Eventually, the trail opens to a clearing and a cave. There’s some debate about what approach should be taken when arrows begin flying through the air. Dodging and charging, some goblins are slayed and some wounds are had. </p>

<p>The companions have discovered The Cragmaw Hideout.</p>

  <p><em>Lost Mine of Phandelver, Part 1. <a href="/2014/08/17/lost-mine-of-phandelver/">The full series may be found here</a>. Here lies actual accounts of fictional events. Spoilers exists if you haven’t yet played this adventure.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>A Dwarf, a Halfling, and a Human are sitting in a bar, barely aware of each others presence. A gruff and tough Dwarf swings the doors open and announces available work escorting his wagon of goods south to the mining town of Phandalin. Many in the room snark at the offer, some consider it deeply, but the noted few rise to their feet and inquire for further details.</p>

<p>Gundren Rockseeker excitingly tells the three that he needs mining equipment brought south for him and his brothers. They’ve found a mine of interest and want to delve further into it- but it will take months of work and more equipment is required. “The trek could be dangerous, as bandits and goblins are known to wander the route, and it will take several days at the least.” Gundren highlights the risks of the trip, but can’t hide his smile or glowing cheeks each time he mentions the mine. </p>

<p>After a deep breath, he finally looks to his audience and bolsters his loudest laugh yet. “Erdrick Gruffbeard! I didn’t know you were in town!” Cousins by blood, Erdrick takes his offer without hesitation and Gundren shows some relief knowing his own blood will take part. Looking at the others, he asks “Who be the other here, then?”</p>

<p>“Welby Greenbottle”, states the Halfling. “I’m happy to travel to Phandalin. I have family in the area I haven’t seen in ages.” Clearly not willing to say anything more, Gundren simply nods with a smile and turns to the Human. “Gosef of Thundertree. Glory comes to those who work for it, and I’m ready to work.” With a deep satisfied laugh, Gundren escorts his hired help to the wagon of goods. </p>

<p>The wagon is full of food, mining equipment, and other common items as previously declared. Gundren mounts his pony, “I’ll pay each of you 10 gold when this wagon arrives in Phandalin. I’m headed there now so I’ll be there well in advance. When you arrive in several days with the wagon your gold will be waiting for you.”</p>

<p>The party rests for the night and gets on their way in the morning. They take The High Road south from Neverwinter and a couple of days pass without event, then east down the Triboar Trial. Suddenly, the wagon stops. Ahead on the road are two dead horses blocking the wagon from easily passing. Small black arrows preclude from their bodies…</p>

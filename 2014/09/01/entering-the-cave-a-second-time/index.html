  <p><em>Part 5 of Lost Mine of Phandelver. <a href="/2014/08/17/lost-mine-of-phandelver/">The full series may be found here</a>. Here lies actual accounts of fictional events. Spoilers exists if you haven’t yet played this adventure.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Entering the cave a second time, the party feels more prepared for what lies ahead. They head back to the kennel with Welby again believing he can succeed where he’s previously failed (fell?). Through the chimney he climbs without err, and he peeks through to the room above. </p>

<p><img src="/content/posts/2014-09-01-entering-the-cave-a-second-time/kennel.jpg" alt="Cave Entrance" title="Image from http://www.ultanya.com/2014/07/lost-mine-of-phandelver-cragmaw-hideout.html. I've modified the original by cropping it." /></p>

<p>Close enough for Welby to smell rests a large wolf, luckily sleeping else Welby’s head may have been a tasty treat. In the center of the room is a small cooking fire, surrounded by several goblins and another rather large humanoid creature. Welby ties off a rope, drops it down the chute, and tries to get a closer look. </p>

<p>At the bottom, Gosef grabs the rope and begins his climb. Unfortunately, history will prove there are more graceful climbers as Gosef clangs and bangs his gear against the stone and slips barely halfway up- immediately alerting the room above. The larger creature stands and commands the goblins around in an unfamiliar language. The goblins hop up and charge towards Welby while the wolf snarls and growls, ready for its snack. </p>

<p>Welby darts down the chimney before they attack, using the rope more as a sliding pole than a grip. Just after landing on the ground the rope begins sliding up the chute, being pulled from above. Erdrick grabs the remaining slack and yanks it with all his might. “Yeeee Ahhhhhhhhh Ohhhh!!!” howls a goblins as it bounces through the chute, banging its body on the ground with a solid thump. </p>

<p>Even though yelling and activity continues above, the rope now remains still.</p>

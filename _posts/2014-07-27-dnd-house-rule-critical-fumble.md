title: D&D House Rule&#58; Critical Fumble
---

This is part of the [D&D House Rules][house_rules] series.


A Natural 1 on any Combat or Skill Check is a Fumble. The player rolls another d20 to determine _how badly they fumbled_. High rolls generally represent no real threat or danger, rolls under 5 represent a setback of some kind, and a Natural 1 is a Critical Fumble that results in a major setback- maybe even pain and/or agony.

##### Example #####

Druber charges a goblin, but rolls a 1 on the attack roll. Knowing this is some kind of Fumble, he rolls another d20 resulting in a 13 (not a Critical Fumble).  
	
>
Druber's charge is clumsy and off-balanced, making him look silly to those who may have seen it happen. Even the goblin laughs at him!
>

On his next turn, Druber attacks- again rolling a Natural 1. His second roll is also a Natural 1, representing a Critical Fumble. 

>
Druber is so embarrassed by his charge that he over compensates his sword thrust- losing grip and flinging his weapon 10 feet forward. Additionally, he's lost balance and fallen face down into the ground. Now he's weaponless and prone!
>

Had his second roll been 2-5 maybe he'd be weaponless or prone, but not both.

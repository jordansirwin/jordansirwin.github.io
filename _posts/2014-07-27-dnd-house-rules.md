title: D&D House Rules
---

With D&D 5e launched and new campaigns firing up all around the globe, I thought I'd call out common house rules I like to use. These rules aren't new or groundbreaking, and are heavily influenced from various systems I've played throughout my life. I simply enjoy playing games that have some flavor of these rules, so I apply them as neccessary.

Each rule will be its own post, so here's a Master List:

* [Skill Check Uncertainty][skill_check_uncertainty]
* [Retrying a skill check][retry_skill_check]
* [Critical Fumble][critical_fumble]

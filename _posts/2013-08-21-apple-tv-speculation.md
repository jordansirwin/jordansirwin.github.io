title: Apple TV Speculation
---

With years of speculation on Apple's plan for "reinventing the television", I figure it's time for me to increase the noise.

My Apple TV Prediction In Bullets For Guided Reading:

* No significant changes to the existing Apple TV (other than boosted hardware specs).

* Overhaul to the existing UI, primarily to accommodate my actual prediction in the next point...

* A new, psuedo-optional, remote that's a striped down iPod Touch. This "iRemote" is simply a thin client for the Apple TV, offering:
  * Apple TV navigation mirrored on the iRemote. (This is the primary, and significant, difference from the existing Remote App)
  * Text inputs trigger the iOS onscreen keyboard.
  * Apps can generate any kind of digital input device they want (game controllers!) on the entire screen of the iRemote. Generic controls available by default, including the existing Remote App controls.

* Apple TV continues to cost only $99, but without the iRemote.

* iRemote bought separately for $99.

* All existing iOS devices are iRemotes via an updated Remote App.

* Existing Apple TVs are backwards compatible with the iRemote via a software update.

With a plan like this, Apple could potentially dominate the television market without actually entering the television market. Who cares what TV you bought or where you got it from, just add on the Apple TV for your entertainment needs!

_edit: Clarified that default controls would be provided for backwards compatibility. Custom controls are optional, not required._

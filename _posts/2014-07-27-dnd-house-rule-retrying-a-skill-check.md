title: D&D House Rule&#58; Retrying a Skill Check
---

This is part of the [D&D House Rules][house_rules] series.


Sometimes a player fails a skill check and there's no good reason they can't just try again. Most systems allow the player to _Take 10_ or _Take 20_, which is an acceptable way to handle most scenarios. Otherwise, I allow the player check again with incrementing difficulty: Each failed check will increase the difficulty of the next check by the failure amount.

##### Example #####

Seri is a stealthy rogue that's found herself alone with a locked treasure chest. She attempts to pick the lock (DC 15), but fails with a 11 (failed by 4). Since the player is not in combat and skillfully stealthed her way into this postiion, there's nothing stopping her from trying again. I allow another attempt, but now the DC is 19 (DC 15 + 4). 

> 
Seri recognises this kind of lock and is confident she should be able to pick it. Knowing she's alone and unknown, she attempts to pick the lock again (DC 19).
>

The player rolls terribly, a 3 (failed by 16). Now, the difficulty to pick the lock is a whopping DC 35 (DC 19 + 16).

>
Seri's lockpick breaks off inside the lock and snaps loudly. You overhear someone asking "What was that?".
>

Eventually, continued failures will identify the check as impossible or introduce new circumstances to the scenario (or both!).

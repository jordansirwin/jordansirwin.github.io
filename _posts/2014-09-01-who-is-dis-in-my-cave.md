The companions head back to the main corridor where a previous flood nearly wiped them out. Met by charging goblins and the wolf seen atop the chimney, the party has little trouble elimating this threat and continues on.

Gosef begins clearing the broken path, paying close attention to the rubble and potential rock slide he may cause. Another loud rush of water appears from ahead, and the players once again dart to the walls for protection. The flood splashes through without victim, but the predicted rock slide hasn't been avoided.

Thinking there's only so much water available, the party continues down the main path- directly challenging another flood to come. The wooden bridge passes above them, and ahead they see a dam indicating the source of the floods. Correctly assessing the limited water supply, Gosef sneaks ahead to scout around the dam.

Gosef looks into a large chamber with two ponds being fed by a thundering waterfall from the mountain. Several goblins stand guard at the far end. Welby sneaks up the dam and into the shallow ponds, taking a hidden position just north of the goblins. Gosef emerges from his hiding place west of them and unleashes his arrows, Erdrick prays for his Sacred Flame to ignite his enemies, and Welby fires volleys of arrows from hiding. Together they quickly dispatch these foes.

"Who is dis in my cave?", loudly snarls the large humanoid creature previously seen by Welby. Walking from the southern chamber, a confident and angry Bugbear wielding a massive morningstar approaches...

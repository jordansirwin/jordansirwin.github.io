title: Setting up this blog, Part 1
---

I think it's only proper that the first post on the new blogging system is about setting up the new blogging system. So meta, much wow.

Here were my goals:

* Avoid WYSIWYG.
* Learn something new and relevant.
* Content must be reasonably exportable.
* The act of writing should be as exciting as the content.

With these goals in mind, I've switched away from Blogger and onto GitHub Pages. But not _just_ GitHub Pages, a full technology stack of goodness to learn and explore with it:

* Sublime for writing.
* Markdown for markup.
* Jekyll for static compilation.
* Git for source control.
* GitHub Pages for hosting.
* Hover for domain registration.

Additionally, I've dedicated myself to doing it the _hard way_ via command line- so I've been forced to learn a great deal more about OSX, Terminal, and Unix Commands. 

In the interest of finishing a post, I'm going to break this into multiple parts. 

Next Part: Setting up my environment.

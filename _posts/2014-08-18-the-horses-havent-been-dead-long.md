The horses haven't been dead long, just a few hours according to Erdrick. Welby darts south into the woods and a defensive position is established around the wagon. Almost immediately a volley of black arrows burst from the northern trees. Welby reacts with his own shots, dropping a once hidden goblin.

Two other goblins charge the wagon, snarling and brandishing worn and rusted scimitars. Erdrick embraces them both, blocking slashes with his shield and responding harshly with his mace. Gosef raises his bow to the northern woods, firing arrow after arrow at the goblins conceiling themselves in the shadows. Welby charges across the road, continuing to fire his own bow. Goblins drop all around, but one stands strong against the party. A shining example of combat and finesse, a champion of melee mastery, a thorn in Erdricks side, but in the end nothing more than a stain on his mace.

With four goblins dead, it becomes clear that they are related to the ambush against the horses and their masters. Welby searches the northern woods, finding a trail not far from the road. He returns to find Gosef and Erdrick studying the site. Other than an empty map tube, nothing of interest is discovered. Eager to complete their job and earn their wages, they return to their wagon and continue towards Phandalin.

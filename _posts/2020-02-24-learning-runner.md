I made and shipped a game :)

It's not a fancy, big game. It's a kids game. A game my kids enjoyed playing, so I decided to publish it to the Apple App Store.

The pitch:

> Run, and jump, and collect your ABCs, 123s, and colors!
>
> Learning Runner is a kid-friendly platformer aimed to educate and entertain. Don't worry about Ads, in-game purchases, or even a "Game Over" screen. This game is built so kids can play without interruption or frustration.
>
> With procedural levels, multiple backgrounds and music, and some fun tricks- the gameplay is always different and the fun is always the same!


It's playable on iPhone and iPad. Technically it also works on Apple TV, but I'm not ready to release it there (yet!).

[You can get it here for $0.99.][appstore]


Why not free? 

Originally, I planned to make it free. But after much reflection, I decided "free" isn't a fair price for anything that took time to create; and I don't have a monetization strategy after aquisition. There's no advertising or in-app purchases. If you buy it, you have it all without disruption.

I hope your family enjoys it. Please leave a review, comments, or [tweet your thoughts to me][twitter].

Oh, there's also a [Support Page][support] and a [Privacy Policy][privacy].

Shipping a game took a lot more effort beyond "building it". I may blog about that in the future.

        <title>Gundren never arrived as expected</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 3 of Lost Mine of Phandelver. &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/17/lost-mine-of-phandelver/&quot;&gt;The full series may be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Here lies actual accounts of fictional events. Spoilers exists if you haven’t yet played this adventure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip takes a couple of days before the ruins of an ancient city balancing the foundation of a new one appears on the horizon. Phandalin is both old and new, large and small, relevant and forgotten- and it’s the destination for the party’s delivery of mining supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/posts/2014-08-26-gundren-never-arrived-as-expected/Phandalin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Phandalin&quot; title=&quot;Image from http://heropresstwo.blogspot.com/2014/06/map-monday-phandalin.html&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Barthen’s Provisions, Elmar Barthen greets the party and beckons his employees to unload the wagon. Erdrick and Elmar strike a conversation resulting in payment for their work, but also learning that Gundren never arrived as expected. Outraged that he should have known the dead horses belonged to his own cousin, Erdrick rallies his companions to return to the trail and find Gundren. All agree but Welby, who claims personal business he needs to tend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in a town a couple of hours, the party makes their exit. Welby watches from the streets, reflecting on the small adventure he’d just had. That brief smile diminishes to suprise when shouts burst from behind him, “Hey Welby! Is that you? I know that’s you! The Redbrands have been waiting on you to come back!”. Now thinking to settle his business another time, Welby rejoins his companions for their next adventure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days later, they rediscover the goblin trail and follow it through snares and pit traps (some spotted, some triggered). Eventually, the trail opens to a clearing and a cave. There’s some debate about what approach should be taken when arrows begin flying through the air. Dodging and charging, some goblins are slayed and some wounds are had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companions have discovered The Cragmaw Hideout.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The horses haven&#39;t been dead long</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 2 of Lost Mine of Phandelver. &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/17/lost-mine-of-phandelver/&quot;&gt;The full series may be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Here lies actual accounts of fictional events. Spoilers exists if you haven’t yet played this adventure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horses haven’t been dead long, just a few hours according to Erdrick. Welby darts south into the woods and a defensive position is established around the wagon. Almost immediately a volley of black arrows burst from the northern trees. Welby reacts with his own shots, dropping a once hidden goblin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/posts/2014-08-18-the-horses-havent-been-dead-long/EOPinheyForestTrails_1L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Forest Trail&quot; title=&quot;Image from http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/pinhey-forest-trails&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two other goblins charge the wagon, snarling and brandishing worn and rusted scimitars. Erdrick embraces them both, blocking slashes with his shield and responding harshly with his mace. Gosef raises his bow to the northern woods, firing arrow after arrow at the goblins conceiling themselves in the shadows. Welby charges across the road, continuing to fire his own bow. Goblins drop all around, but one stands strong against the party. A shining example of combat and finesse, a champion of melee mastery, a thorn in Erdricks side, but in the end nothing more than a stain on his mace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With four goblins dead, it becomes clear that they are related to the ambush against the horses and their masters. Welby searches the northern woods, finding a trail not far from the road. He returns to find Gosef and Erdrick studying the site. Other than an empty map tube, nothing of interest is discovered. Eager to complete their job and earn their wages, they return to their wagon and continue towards Phandalin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A dwarf, a halfling, and a human are sitting in a bar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part 1 of Lost Mine of Phandelver. &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/17/lost-mine-of-phandelver/&quot;&gt;The full series may be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Here lies actual accounts of fictional events. Spoilers exists if you haven’t yet played this adventure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dwarf, a halfling, and a human are sitting in a bar, barely aware of each others presence. A gruff and tough dwarf swings the doors open and announces available work escorting his wagon of goods south to the mining town of Phandalin. Many in the room snark at the offer, some consider it deeply, but the noted few rise to their feet and inquire for further details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/posts/2014-08-17-a-dwarf-halfling-and-human-are-sitting-in-a-bar/old-world-tavern.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old Tavern&quot; title=&quot;Image from http://dungeonsmaster.com/2010/05/tavern-trappings/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gundren Rockseeker excitingly tells the three that he needs mining equipment brought south for him and his brothers. They’ve found a mine of interest and want to delve further into it- but it will take months of work and more equipment is required. “The trek could be dangerous as bandits and goblins are known to wander the route, and it will take several days at the least.” Gundren highlights the risks of the trip, but can’t hide his smile or glowing cheeks each time he mentions the mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a deep breath, he finally looks to his audience and bolsters his loudest laugh yet. “Erdrick Gruffbeard! I didn’t know you were in town!” Cousins by blood, Erdrick takes his offer without hesitation and Gundren shows some relief knowing his own blood will take part. Looking at the others, he asks “Who be the other here, then?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Welby Greenbottle”, states the halfling. “I’m happy to travel to Phandalin. I have family in the area I haven’t seen in ages.” Clearly not willing to say anything more, Gundren simply nods with a smile and turns to the human. “Gosef of Thundertree. Glory comes to those who work for it, and I’m ready to work.” With a deep satisfied laugh, Gundren escorts his hired help to the wagon of goods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wagon is full of food, mining equipment, and other common items as previously declared. Gundren mounts his pony, “I’ll pay each of you 10 gold when this wagon arrives in Phandalin. I’m headed there now so I’ll be there well in advance. When you arrive with the wagon your gold will be waiting for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party rests for the night and gets on their way in the morning. They take The High Road south from Neverwinter and a couple of days pass without event, then east down the Triboar Trial. Suddenly, the wagon stops. Ahead on the road are two dead horses blocking the wagon from passing. Small black arrows preclude from their bodies…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>The Low Status of Software Engineers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/about/&quot;&gt;Michael O. Church’s&lt;/a&gt; intriguing article exploring the low status of software engineers to upper management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other-half-works-an-adventure-in-the-low-status-of-software-engineers/&quot;&gt;How the Other Half Works: an Adventure in the Low Status of Software Engineers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few fun tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;… for a point that I’ll come back to, software engineers lack the social status necessary to make others invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For a software engineer, “relocation” is usually some shitty $3,000 lump-sum package, because “software engineer”, to executives, means “22-year-old clueless male with few possessions, and with free storage of the parental category”. On the other hand, if you’re a manager, you might be seen as a real human being with actual concerns about relocating to another part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What most of us don’t realize is that this culture of mandatory “passion” lowers our social status, because it encourages us to work unreasonably hard and irrespective of conditions. The fastest way to lose social status is to show acceptance of low social status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If programmers want to be taken seriously, and we should be taken seriously and we certainly should want this, we’re going to have to take stock of our compromised position and fix it, even if that’s “getting political”. We’re going to have to stop glorifying pointless self-sacrifice for what is ultimately someone else’s business transaction, and start asserting ourselves and our values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go read it yourself. Please. You deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Value was either too large or too small for a UInt32</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Useless error message in Visual Studio when committing code into TFS that hasn’t been saved. It’s both uninformative and completely disconnected from the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I agree that commiting unsaved code into source control should be prevented, I also believe a reasonable error message to identify the problem is too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>D&amp;D House Rules</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With D&amp;amp;D 5e launched and new campaigns firing up all around the globe, I thought I’d call out common house rules I like to use. These rules aren’t new or groundbreaking, and are heavily influenced from various systems I’ve played throughout my life. I simply enjoy playing games that have some flavor of these rules, so I apply them as neccessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each rule will be its own post, so here’s a Master List:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
